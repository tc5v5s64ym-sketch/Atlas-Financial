/* Focused proof for Forecast.nextMove() — what the next move achieves.
 * `node test-nextmove.js`
 *
 * The line under **What happens after** on the Plan page: what completing the
 * first written action does to the window the household is looking at. Until
 * this move `public/plan.js` decided it, where no test could reach it. B73
 * item 5 recorded the mutation that proves so — `actionCovers`'s
 * `>= fundingGap` weakened to `>= fundingGap / 2` leaves `npm test` green — and
 * it was reproduced on this branch before the authority moved: the page source
 * mutated, `npm test` run, ALL 15 SUITES PASSED.
 *
 * Why the comparison is the decision worth guarding: `plan.actions[0].amount`
 * is a FIXED figure authored by hand in `data.json`, sized for the default
 * $500 buffer. The gap is dynamic. Raise the buffer and the same $1,050 action
 * that covers a $1,043.16 gap does not come close to a $2,043.16 one — so the
 * weakened comparison publishes "the buffer is restored" over figures that do
 * not restore it.
 *
 * Five kinds of check, and they prove different things:
 *
 *   1. HAND-COMPUTED CASES. The engine is handed literal facts — a $1,000
 *      action against a $1,600 gap, a $4,000 gap with $3,759.69 of usable
 *      funding — and the expected outcome and every figure in it are reasoned
 *      from those facts in the comment above each case. Nothing here re-runs
 *      the selection to find out what it should be.
 *   2. THE MONEY BOUNDARY, both sides. Half a cent is the convention every
 *      buffer comparison in this engine already stops on, and it is stated
 *      here as a literal $0.005 rather than read out of the engine: a gap
 *      $0.004 above the action is covered, a gap a full cent above is not, and
 *      an action a cent short does not cover.
 *   3. RECONCILIATION. What the action covers plus what is left has to equal
 *      the gap; the unfunded shortfall has to be the funding result's own. An
 *      identity is checked, not a re-implementation.
 *   4. MUTATION. The coverage comparison, the remainder, the outcome ordering,
 *      the due-date test, the timing-and-coverage conjunction and the unfunded
 *      guard are each broken on purpose in the engine source, and the answer
 *      has to change. The B73 mutation is the first of them, at its new home;
 *      the blocking review's own defect is another.
 *   5. MIGRATION EQUIVALENCE, then the real page. The exact expression
 *      `public/plan.js` ran at 098f90b, against the real published plan at
 *      twelve settings, must still produce the same sentence — through the
 *      page's own wording map and the real formatters, not through a copy of
 *      them. Then the page is booted at five knob settings and the card is read
 *      back, because a proof that stops at the wording map cannot see a
 *      template reading a field the engine stopped returning.
