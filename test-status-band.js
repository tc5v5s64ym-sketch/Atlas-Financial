/* Focused proof for Forecast.planStatus() and the funding-source verdicts that
 * Forecast.recommend() now returns. `node test-status-band.js`
 *
 * These are the two most prominent financial verdicts on the site: the band at
 * the top of the Plan page, which selects which of seven conclusions the
 * household reads about the next 13 weeks, and the cards a few lines below it,
 * which say whether each account can cover the opening gap. Until this move
 * `public/plan.js` decided both, where no test could reach them — B73 recorded
 * ten mutations to those expressions that left `npm test` green.
 *
 * Four kinds of check, and they prove different things:
 *
 *   1. HAND-COMPUTED CASES. The engine is handed literal facts — a $5,543.16
 *      gap against $2,691.85 and $1,067.84 of usable funding, a $1,500/week
 *      setting that runs to −$809.12 — and the expected verdict and every
 *      figure in it are reasoned from those facts in the comment above each
 *      case. Nothing here re-runs the selection to find out what it should be.
 *   2. RECONCILIATION. The funding figures have to add up: every allocated part
 *      plus the shortfall equals the gap, and borrowed plus free equals the
 *      allocation. An identity is checked, not a re-implementation.
 *   3. MUTATION. The verdict ordering, the buffer threshold, the first-breach
 *      selection, the coverage comparison and the shortfall arithmetic are each
 *      broken on purpose in the engine source, and the answer has to change. A
 *      decision that cannot be broken was not being tested.
 *   4. MIGRATION EQUIVALENCE. The exact expressions `public/plan.js` ran before
 *      this move, against the real published plan at ten settings, must still
 *      produce the same band and the same cards — through the page's own
 *      wording maps and the real formatters, not through a copy of them. The
 *      authority moves; the household reads the same words.
