/* Mechanical coverage guard for the named financial-authority surfaces.
 *
 * This deliberately does NOT claim to discover every place financial authority
 * could ever appear. B75 established that such a claim would itself be a false
 * green. Instead, this guard covers the mechanically enumerable surfaces the
 * repository has already named:
 *
 *   1. Forecast exports — every export must be either an explicitly classified
 *      non-authority helper or named in ARCHITECTURE.md's incumbent table.
 *   2. data.json plan policy keys — actions, nextDollar and budget.
 *   3. the calculators that used to live in public/app.js, the shared page core:
 *      each must be defined in the engine and absent from the page.
 *   4. the two artifact-writing scripts already named as financial authorities:
 *      periods.js and calendar-ics.js.
 *
 * Page scripts that decide rather than render remain the B73 review class because
 * there is no closed mechanical signature for them. This guard does not pretend
 * otherwise.
