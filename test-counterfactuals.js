/* Focused proof for Forecast.counterfactuals(). `node test-counterfactuals.js`
 *
 * Two alternative-reality questions the Plan page publishes answers to:
 *
 *   FULL GAP COVERAGE   "with only $3,759.69 of the $5,543.16 gap fundable.
 *                        Cover the whole gap and it becomes $1,085/week."
 *   GAP FUNDED BY DRAW  "Covering the opening gap from it instead of Amanda's
 *                        transfer brings that crossing forward to 31 August."
 *
 * `public/plan.js` used to compose both. It invented a funding source holding
 * `available: Infinity`, and it chose `fundingDebtId: 'heloc'` and ran its own
 * second `recommend` and `projectDebts`. The arithmetic was always the
 * engine's; what lived in the page was WHICH alternative to run, WHAT stands
 * for the assumption, under WHICH scenario, and WHETHER the answer means
 * anything — four decisions no test could reach. B73 item 4.
 *
 * Six kinds of check, and they prove different things:
 *
 *   1. HAND-COMPUTED CASES. A fixture whose funding arithmetic is small enough
 *      to do on paper: a $4,600 gap against $1,600 of free money and $1,500 of
 *      borrowable headroom leaves $1,500 no source reaches. Every expected
 *      figure is reasoned in the comment above the case, not read back off the
 *      engine.
 *   2. RECONCILIATION. The returned counterfactual has to agree with the
 *      `recommend` and `projectDebts` runs underneath it — the top-up equals
 *      the shortfall exactly, the alternative's allocation closes the gap, and
 *      the alternative's draw appears in the debt walk once, on the day the
 *      injection is placed.
 *   3. PROPAGATION. Scenario, target buffer, income overrides, disabled
 *      commitments and debt state must reach the counterfactual unchanged. The
 *      counterfactual is allowed to differ from the plan on screen in exactly
 *      one thing: the funding assumption.
 *   4. NOT-APPLICABLE. Six of the twelve states this authority can be asked
 *      about have no honest answer. Each returns a reason a test can name,
 *      rather than a fabricated date or a meaningless weekly figure.
 *   5. MUTATION. Each decision is broken on purpose in the engine source and
 *      the answer has to change. A decision that cannot be broken was not
 *      being tested — which is what B73 recorded about these two blocks while
 *      they lived in the page.
 *   6. THE REAL PAGE. `public/plan.js` is booted against a stub DOM on the real
 *      `data.json` and the two sentences are read back, so the proof reaches
 *      the words the household is shown rather than stopping at the engine.

 *                        so the draw alternative is a real alternative.
 *   $2,000  gap $2,600   savings are exhausted and the line is drawn on, so
 *                        the plan ALREADY uses it and there is no alternative.
 *   $4,000  gap $4,600   both together reach $3,100 and $1,500 is unfundable,
