   Both answers are the engine's. The payoff figures are
   `Forecast.payoffDebts` / `Forecast.payoffModel`'s and the renewal comparison
   is `Forecast.renewal`'s. This file reads the controls, hands them over, and
   formats what comes back: it compounds nothing, charges no interest, solves
   for no payment, and decides neither which debt may be modelled nor which side
   of the renewal trade is better. Everything here is wording, colour and
