 * failure-state gap: when Forecast's planned-cost funding schedule says
 * the selected payday cannot meet everything, Amanda can answer how
 * short it is, when the money is needed, and which planned costs
 * Forecast's funding schedule names in the shortfall.
 *
 * The block renders only when schedule.status === 'funding-gap' AND
 * schedule.gap.payday exactly equals the selected pay-period row's
 * payday. Exact equality only: never a future gap on an earlier payday,
 * never the first global gap on every pay period, never cashDate as the
 * payday match, never nearest-payday. A pre-opening gap
 * (gap.payday === null) is a different identity and never attaches to a
 * visible payday; a residual period whose cycle payday predates the
 * Forecast opening cannot borrow a future gap. With no exact-match gap
 * the block is omitted — no shortfall for this payday is not an
 * unavailable figure.
 *
 * Every figure is a Forecast reprint: shortBy is never derived from
 * required - available page-side, affected costs are never totaled, and

  //   3. Exact payday plan — the schedule's first payday row, labelled

  // The planned-cost funding block shows the EXACT payday's plan: the
  // first payday row in the Forecast publication. The
  // schedule arrives on the Budget's active inputs (the caller
  // regenerates it through the incumbent Forecast chain via
  // budgetMonthPlanSpendSchedule, so knob changes recompute it; the
  // advice publication alone would stay on the recommended weekly).
  // Exact identity only: never period.start (the selected pay period's
  // opening, which can predate the forecast's first payday), never a
  // nearest-payday substitution. The row is labelled with its exact
  // date so it can never be read as the period's money. A trusted $0
  // contribution renders $0.00; unknown fails closed, never $0. Named
  // allocations are reprinted in Forecast order — never summed.

  // The planned-spending block is the Nest Money funding plan: the exact
  // payday's Plan-Spend-attributable contribution, with its named
  // purposes, is rendered as an earmark/funding-plan amount only.
  // Everything else stays in the BILLS/chequing account. The block is
  // not a transfer or set-aside instruction, and the household is not
  // asked to subtract prior moves to make it safe — the engine
  // publishes no prior Nest Money move state, so neither a move
  // directive nor a subtract-to-be-safe instruction can be reconciled

  // (schedule contribution + nonPlanSpendProtected) and the page reprints
  // both. Unknown is not $0 — anything Forecast did not publish renders
  // as unavailable. Nothing here is a transfer or a payment made.

  // carries its Forecast-published trust state ('calculated' | 'estimated'),
