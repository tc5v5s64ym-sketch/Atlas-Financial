/* Focused proof for Forecast.mission(). `node test-mission.js`
 *
 * The mission is the most prominent instruction the site gives: one sentence at
 * the top of the Plan page saying what to do about the next 13 weeks. Which
 * instructions it contains, and in what order, is a financial decision, and
 * until this move `public/plan.js` made it where no test could reach it.
 *
 * Three kinds of check, and they prove different things:
 *
 *   1. HAND-COMPUTED STATES. The engine is handed literal facts — a gap of
 *      $1,043.16 that can be covered, a card $612 over its limit, a HELOC that
 *      crosses on 30 April — and the expected instructions are reasoned from
 *      those facts in the comment above each case. Nothing here re-runs the
 *      selection to find out what it should be.
 *   2. MUTATION. Each decision branch is broken on purpose, in the inputs and
 *      in the engine source, and the mission has to change. A branch that
 *      cannot be broken was not being tested.
 *   3. MIGRATION EQUIVALENCE. The exact expression `public/plan.js` used before
 *      this move, run against the real published plan, must still produce the
 *      same sentence — through the page's own wording map and the real
 *      formatters, not through a copy of them. The authority moves; the
 *      household reads the same words.
