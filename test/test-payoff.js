/* Focused proof for the payoff modeller. `node test/test-payoff.js`
 *
 * "If we paid $X a month, when is this gone and what does it cost?" is the
 * question a household acts on fastest — it is one slider and four preset
 * buttons, and the answer is a number of years. Until this move
 * `public/modellers.js` and `public/app.js` answered it themselves: `payoff()`
 * in the shared PAGE core ran the projection, `solveFor()` ran the annuity
 * behind "clear in 5 / 3 / 1 years", and `bounds()` picked the slider's floor
 * from an interest charge it computed itself. None of it was reachable from the
 * node suite. That is `B73`, and this is the last recorded instance of it.
 *
 * Six kinds of check, and they prove different things:
 *
 *   0. THE CONVENTION, per debt type, against evidence from outside this code.
 *      A rate is meaningless without the convention it is charged under, and the
 *      page applied ONE to every debt: `annual × 30 / 365`, which charges twelve
 *      30-day months — 360 days — for every 365 that pass. The prime-linked
 *      convention is checked against TD's own stated remaining amortisation on
 *      this household's mortgage.
 *   0a. AND HOW CLOSELY IT IS MODELLED, which is a separate question the first
 *      draft of this file ran together with the first. A card charges a daily
 *      rate over the days in each statement cycle; a monthly model prices the
 *      AVERAGE cycle. That is exact over a year, because consecutive cycles tile
 *      the calendar by construction, and approximate for any single period. It
 *      is benchmarked against the published TD/MBNA 30-day form, bounded across
 *      28-to-32-day cycles, and the multi-period effect is measured by walking a
 *      real varying-cycle schedule from every possible starting month.
 *   1. HAND-COMPUTED CASES. Balances small enough to walk on paper, with the
 *      expected figures written as literals.
 *   2. INDEPENDENT DERIVATION. Every projection is confirmed a second time by
 *      methods the engine does not use: a month-by-month balance walk that has
 *      to land on zero, and the annuity's present-value identity, which is a
 *      different arrangement of the algebra from the engine's logarithm.
 *   3. PROPAGATION. This is one coupled model, not a payoff calculator with a
 *      private copy of the debt picture. Move the balance, the pending charges,
 *      the rate or the obligation, and every payoff conclusion moves with it.
 *   4. MUTATION. Each material formula and branch is broken on purpose in the
 *      engine source, and the answer has to change.
 *   5. MIGRATION EQUIVALENCE. The exact expressions the page ran before this
 *      move, against the real published inputs, at every slider position the
 *      page can reach. They do NOT all match, and the three reasons are proved
 *      one at a time: restoring the old rate convention, the old balance rule
 *      and the old minimum to the engine reproduces the old published figures to
 *      the cent, which is what makes those three the whole of the change.
