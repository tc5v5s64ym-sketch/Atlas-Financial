/* Amanda salary vs coaching/business vs household transfers.
 *
 * Acceptance corpus: docs/source_intake/PAYDAY_ACCEPTANCE_2026-08-14.md
 * Owner-confirmed 2026-08-22: the two fixed Tennis BC salary deposits are
 * Forecast household income. Owner-clarified 2026-08-31 / restated
 * 2026-09-01: they first land in TENNIS INCOME, which is not Current
 * Balance; household-visible posting proof is the later BILLS transfer.
 * A later transfer of those dollars is not a second income line. Future
 * confirmed salary remains Forecast income. Coaching surplus is not
 * forecast. The raw TENNIS INCOME balance remains non-spendable. Fusion
 * settlement and the
 * Hydro September dated due stay the B91 current-state cutover, not this
 * income-model outcome. This suite proves the semantic split on classified
 * movements plus existing Forecast.expandEvents. It is not a second income
 * engine.
 *
 * Independent proof: hand addition of named classified amounts. That is
 * not a second call to expandEvents or simulate.
