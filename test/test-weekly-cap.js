/* Focused proof for the weekly↔monthly conversion and the discretionary-room
 * verdict. `node test/test-weekly-cap.js`
 *
 * The household reads a WEEKLY figure; the budget is derived in MONTHS. One
 * conversion sits between them, and it decides a published verdict —
 * "Discretionary room — nothing left. The cap is below what normal life
 * costs." Until this move `public/plan.js` owned all of it, and so did
 * `scripts/figures-snapshot.js`: three copies of one constant, none of them
 * compared with the others. The page's could be changed from 4.35 to 4.00 —
 * moving every budget-derived /wk figure it publishes by about 8% — and
 * `npm test` stayed green.
 *
 * Four kinds of check:
 *
 *   1. THE CALENDAR IDENTITY, re-derived here rather than imported. `Forecast`
 *      deliberately does not export the constant: a test that imported it
 *      would prove the engine agrees with itself. This file computes
 *      365.25 / 12 / 7 from the definition of a Gregorian year and requires
 *      the engine to match, so the two can genuinely disagree.
 *   2. HAND-COMPUTED CASES on literal fixtures, with every expected figure
 *      reasoned in the comment above it.
 *   3. THE BOUNDARY, both sides — a cap above, exactly at, and below the
 *      essential need.
 *   4. MUTATION — the constant, the verdict, the room and the shortfall each
 *      broken in the engine source, and the answer required to change.
