# Travel Visa next annual-fee planning estimate - 2026-10-07

This is the minimum source and explicit-approval record for one future planning input. `data.json` `plan.bills` owns the input; Forecast owns its consequences. This record is not a posted balance, verified fee schedule, issuer statement, payment instruction or new settlement identity.

## Owner instruction and provenance

The owner requested a next Travel Visa annual-fee estimate of approximately **CAD 149 around October 6, 2027**, based on the owner-reported annual fee posted October 6, 2026. The ChatGPT decision desk delegated this independent, authorized planning follow-up after #541 merged at `c2f4ca19bba7a772be218bbc412da9920926d0ee` (source thread `01a0fe55-68a7-7255-a88c-1707cdede0e6`). No bank or provider read was performed for this change, and no institution statement was independently inspected.

The amount and next posting date remain **ESTIMATED**. The October 6 planning anchor is not an issuer payment due date, statement minimum or promise that the fee will post on that exact day. A later verified notice or posted charge can replace the estimate through the usual authorized input/evidence path.

## Exact canonical preview and authorization

Append one row to `plan.bills`, id `travelvisa-annual-fee-2027`:

| Field | Proposed value |
| --- | --- |
| Label | Travel Visa annual fee |
| Frequency | `yearly` - native annual planning cadence |
| First planning occurrence | `firstDue: 2027-10-06`, month 10, day 6 |
| Amount | `149` CAD |
| Amount trust | `confidence: estimated` |
| Date trust | `dateConfidence: estimated` |
| Paying account | canonical `travelvisa` |
| Joint cash | `jointCash: false` - existing card-paid reserved-gravity path |
| Household category | none (`budgetCategory: null`) |
| Provenance | owner-authorized estimate and owner-reported 2026-10-06 basis in the row note |

`docs/skills/evidence-intake.md` step 4 permits canonical writes through the earned preview/approve path **or an explicit owner-approved edit recorded on the merge card**. This request supplies the exact amount, estimated date, account, trust and purpose; it covers this input edit. The provider balance-refresh CLI supports posted-state/cutover approvals and does not author a new planned bill. Its allowlist is not extended, and no unsupported balance-refresh apply is used. The isolated local preview names the exact added row and confirms there is no edit to existing canonical rows, opening or debt stock.

## Preservation and closure

This adds no 2026 event, historical arrears, issuer due date, payment, minimum confirmation or provider identity. The native annual model projects later anniversaries as estimated; these are not confirmed charges. Actual future fee amount, timing and whether the card remains open still require later evidence. The already-posted 2026 fee retains its existing Other Spend/card-coverage treatment. Existing scheduled monthly fees remain separate. Opening, balances, pending amounts, savings assignments, all prior bills/commitments, category policy and financial evidence remain unchanged.

The existing `Forecast.expandEvents`, yearly card-paid funding sequence and Plan Spend consume this dated input. A once-only card bill is not included by the native planned-spend selector; yearly with firstDue uses the established annual-fee representation without runtime work. No Forecast, renderer, provider, runtime or test-registry code is changed. Independent tests use invented amounts/dates/accounts, not the owner amount or a copied/scaled ledger. Exact-head financial and trust verification is required before merge; the builder does not merge.

## Independent verification

`node test/proof-travel-visa-annual-estimate.js` passes three proof groups: exact canonical semantic scope (removing the added row reproduces base main byte-independent JSON values), an invented annual card-reserve ledger, and preservation of current-year unexpected-fee treatment, native card coverage and observed cash/debt. The invented example reserves 73.41 once in April 2031 and creates no chequing bill debit or settlement. Its prior-year window is empty; later annual projections retain estimate trust. The new standalone proof is intentionally not added to the shared registry owned by another task.

Six incumbent suites pass: evidence-use register, authority coverage, Forecast, yearly card-paid bill behavior, month-end bill reconciliation, and the scheduled-fee allowance contract.

The optional `node test/browser-travel-visa-annual-estimate.js [installed-browser] [local-output]` uses actual Plan Spend boot, independent invented observations, and no external requests or writes. Desktop 1440, mobile 390 and narrow 320 pixels pass estimated-label/cash-date/native card-paid checks, keyboard details and overflow checks. The page labels the date **Cash date** and the row **ESTIMATED**. It does not publish an issuer payment due date. No real financial screenshot is included.

The native general bill event does not separately publish `dateConfidence`; that metadata stays on the input while the live Plan Spend consumer publishes overall ESTIMATED trust and cash-planning date terminology. No trust runtime is changed or a date promoted to verified.
