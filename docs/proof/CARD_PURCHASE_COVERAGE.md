# Card purchase coverage: local candidate and independent oracle

This is a synthetic-only candidate, not production household facts or a
deployment claim. Parent authorized replacing #491's inferred split with one
evidence-qualified ledger and immediate cash protection. No transaction,
account, canonical amount, baseline or credential was changed.

## State and coordination boundary

The takeover began at #491 head 3f805ee19467f0bbb5dae84b2314170e4e738fec.
Both that history and the later remote head
83eda4aa7b3ba561f56e12ab472235980c19f1d9 are preserved in the local candidate.
Checkpoint 72024e5715745908937d307cff43ae0e8245f4ad implemented the explicit
ledger; merge a1a5a77 reconciled the changed remote. Local merge
c7276c5edc5cb046b1fa471bd52db48e676aee7a incorporated main
feb40019a931fe93ab18fccf6290886920c41d7a, including #492 native-unit guards.
Subsequent consumer/fixture repairs are recorded in the next commit. The
exact tested head and results belong in the evidence manifest and PR record;
this document cannot embed its own future commit SHA.

Through the local B1 checkpoint, parent held publication while coordinating
the changed remote. Nothing was pushed at those checkpoints and no competing
PR was created. Parent owns independent Systems review and any merge.

## Independent supplied-dollar oracle

Early posted card-bill identity evidence can leave its future scheduled cash
reservation in the walk. Forecast credits only that duplicate hold against the
same uniquely linked, posted purchase's remaining coverage. Full purchase
coverage, the planned Budget deduction and explicit payment allocations remain
unchanged. Pending matching bills retain the existing pending exclusion and
never gain settlement from this credit. The independent invented regression is
`test/test-posted-card-bill-protection.js`: 500 cash minus one 73.21 purchase is
426.79 across current and next-period early posting; an unrelated 19.37 purchase
leaves 407.42. Currency, account, amount, identity, ambiguity and unavailable
coverage controls withhold the credit.

The fixture supplies Bills 500, prior card debt 400, groceries allowance 150,
scheduled minimum 25 and a confirmed empty coverage opening.

| Snapshot | Bills | Card debt | Groceries spent once | Uncovered | Available after minimum, remaining groceries and coverage |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Before | 500 | 400 | 0 | 0 | 500 - 25 - 150 = 325 |
| Purchase 30 | 500 | 430 | 30 | 30 | 500 - 25 - 120 - 30 = 325 |
| Confirmed backfill 10 | 490 | 420 | 30 | 20 | 490 - 25 - 120 - 20 = 325 |
| Confirmed 25 split: 20 backfill, 5 prior debt | 465 | 395 | 30 | 0 | 465 - 25 - 120 = 320 |

The $20/$5 split is an explicitly supplied invented intent record. Amount,
date and payment payee cannot establish it. Without that intent or its unique
posted Bills debit/card credit, precise funding is unavailable and no split
is published. The scheduled minimum stays reserved. Existing exact
represented-events confirmation can separately prove issuer settlement.

Both original #491 and the changed 83eda4a remote label an unconfirmed $10
as backfill and drop the remaining $20 before labeling the next $25 as card
payment. Independent red controls are ../pr491-intent-red.log and
../pr491-83-intent-red.log. The latter exercises the exact changed remote
using invented CAD rows, with no Bills pair or intent supplied.

## Proposed input contract, exercised only in fixtures

Forecast.visaPaymentReconciliation retains its historical API name and owns
one ledger for mapped revolving cards. The observer supplies sanitized,
account-bound coverage references, native currency and provider-directed
replacement flags. References establish identity, never intent.

plan.cardPurchaseCoverage contains a confirmed CAD Bills opening with a
cutover date and explicit carried purchases (ref, accountId, date, amount,
covered). An empty opening is still an owner confirmation, not an inference
from a bounded fetch or a debt balance. A complete posted/pending observation
must cover that cutover through the financial as-of; the existing bounded
history cap is retained.

payments name unique debitRef and creditRef, confirmed purchase allocations
and an explicit otherAmount/otherPurpose. Allocations and the remainder must
conserve the whole posted pair in exact cents. Other purpose is prior-debt,
required-payment or other; none automatically settles the scheduled minimum.
refunds explicitly link a posted credit to its purchase. reversals name the
original payment and unique reversed card/Bills legs, and may reverse only
previously allocated amounts. Used identities cannot be credited twice.

No production opening or allocation has been installed. Needed owner facts
are recorded in docs/01_OPEN_QUESTIONS.md. Missing opening, currency, pairing,
identity or intent remains unknown. Foreign/missing native units and mixed
replacement evidence do not publish raw values as CAD spend or coverage;
to_base is not conversion authority.

## Financial and publication boundary

Purchases retain existing category classification and count once. A unique
pending revolving match of a still-due card-paid bill is reserved as that
bill once; coverage does not also hold the pending authorization as
uncovered spend. Coverage
adds protection to the existing simulation cash floor; it does not subtract
cash again, inject money, add a scheduled expense or create debt. Actual Bills
cash and card balances remain observer facts. Fully covered rows leave the
active list and keep audit detail. Partial uncovered amounts carry until an
explicit coverage allocation or linked refund changes them.

Unknown coverage withholds precise capacity, funding, weekly permission and
extra-debt instructions. Known bill facts, named costs and observed cash are
retained. Forecast alone withholds usable money; OperatingAnswer and
RefreshTrust copy that publication. Known spending-category facts remain
available. Calendar extra-debt rows and their existing printer preserve
unavailable rather than displaying an invented zero. With no card
evidence/configuration, the incumbent publication is
unchanged; its independent immutable savings before/after proof passes.

BillDetail prints this ledger only. public/plan.js passes the active coverage
publication into the existing #491 renderer. No original-plan/actual totals
or goal-fulfillment selector is implemented here. Expected UI-follow-up
overlap is calendarPeriodWaterfalls, paydayAllocation and selected-period
funding/withheld state; parent owns sequencing.

## Verification and remaining gates

Independent synthetic tests cover observed cash/debt/category reconciliation,
partial and combined allocations, refund/reversal conservation, pending
purchases and legs, missing intent/pair/opening/identity/date, native units,
privacy and separate issuer minimum evidence. The annual-card-fee financial
assertion remains unchanged. Legacy synthetic observations declare CAD units
where their fixtures intend CAD; declarations do not supply payment intent.
Old funding expectations were adjusted only where they released an uncovered
purchase hold or claimed usable cash without confirmation. No real financial
fixture, amount or account has been edited.

The full run frozen at c7276c5 passed 272/287 suites. Fifteen failures were
triaged into consumer/fixture mismatches, the omitted authority printer name,
and four Windows execution constraints. Focused fixes preserve known
category/bill facts while withholding precise permission. Windows checks use
process-only Git Bash and core.autocrlf=false; CurrentUser encryption checks
need unsandboxed execution. The reference snapshot harness now uses a Windows
directory junction rather than a privileged file symlink, keeping the same
financial oracle. No suites are skipped or assertions weakened to pass the
platform. A fresh exact-head full run is required after these changes.

Authenticated headless Edge exercised the actual Budget consumer on c7276c5
with fully synthetic server data. It printed the $80 purchase hold from the
Forecast ledger. Local evidence: ../491-browser-proof.json,
../491-browser-coverage.png and ../491-browser-dom.txt. Repeat on the frozen
final candidate; earlier evidence does not certify a later head.

Production remains unconfirmed until the household supplies the opening and
explicit links recorded in docs/01_OPEN_QUESTIONS.md. Independent Systems
review and parent publication coordination remain separate gates. No claim
of deployment, production reconciliation or lender non-payment is made.

## Local Systems review B1 repair

Independent review blocked 1036127 because the active funding legend/chart
showed only $95 of components against $175 needed after an invented $80
purchase. The partial $20 backfill omitted the remaining $60; full coverage
resolved the discrepancy. Capacity arithmetic was already correct.

The printer now copies Forecast's cardPurchaseCoverageReserve into the Today
legend/chart and detailed from-today evidence. Copy names this cash protection
separately from the minimum and category. No new page money calculation is
introduced. The existing chart percentage calculation uses the published hold.

The supplied-cent oracle checks before/purchase/partial/full at 1440px and
390px: required cash 175/175/155/95, card hold 0/80/60/0, cash
500/500/480/420, and capacity 325 throughout. Minimum 25 and original
groceries 150 remain separate; spending is 80 once after purchase. The standard
card-coverage suite executes the real printer and totals its printed cents
independently. test/browser-card-purchase-coverage.js exercises authenticated
Budget click paths at both widths and records visible parts, chart geometry,
copy, no overflow/runtime errors and screenshots. Run it with CHROME_PATH
and optional ATLAS_CARD_COVERAGE_EVIDENCE_DIR. Exact-head browser results and
review belong in their evidence manifests; the earlier blocking verdict does
not transfer to this repair. Publication was held at that local checkpoint.

## Authorized integration after publication hold

Dale explicitly resumed work on 2026-10-04 at 14:33 UTC. Integration preserves
remote PR head d3cb2ce3935ae842a19e04616421872530b17deb and current main
9c4601bafe82297fd7984dd81135452c19261b9c as ancestors, retaining the reviewed
local ledger and B1 repair. The rebase's legitimate #492 changes were already
present; its inferred previous-payment split and observer-side split are
superseded by the sole evidence-qualified ledger. No remote commit is deleted.

Current main's original-plan/actual-progress, exact-period goal evidence and
newer native Budget UI are preserved. Their scope and unconfirmed fulfillment
remain distinct from available cash. A fresh independent current-main fixture
reproduces $405 capacity without purchase coverage against the supplied-dollar
$325 oracle; an $80 purchase reduced remaining groceries to $70 without moving
$500 Bills cash, and the $25 minimum remains separate.

Fourteen focused suites and eight authenticated desktop/mobile states passed
on the integration before this documentation update. Both revisions generated
their own canonical snapshots; all 568 figures matched current main. Exact
final-head tests, browser manifests, full CI and review status belong in the
PR/evidence record. The earlier local Systems PASS applies only to 143ea01,
not this newer integration. Publication is authorized only after fresh remote
head checks and by normal fast-forward push; concurrent movement stops it.
No production opening/intent or provider write is authorized by this repair.
