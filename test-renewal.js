/* Focused proof for Forecast.renewal(). `node test-renewal.js`
 *
 * The May 2027 renewal is the largest decision the site models: whether to fold
 * a $201,586 interest-only HELOC into a $546,027 mortgage at maturity. Until
 * this move `public/modellers.js` computed the whole comparison itself — the
 * HELOC's compounded balance, both interest totals, today's household cash and
 * the difference against it — so the arithmetic behind that decision sat where
 * the node suite could not reach it. That is `B73`.
 *
 * Five kinds of check, and they prove different things:
 *
 *   0. PUBLISHED BENCHMARKS. Canada quotes fixed and variable mortgage rates on
 *      different compounding, and the modeller used to price every rate as if
 *      it were variable — including the fixed quotes TD will offer in April
 *      2027. The two conventions are checked against figures published outside
 *      this repository: TD's own $300,000-at-3.00% example ($2,069.07 over 15
 *      years, $1,419.74 over 25) and the standard Canadian $100,000-at-6.00%
 *      figure ($639.81, against $644.30 compounded monthly). A benchmark
 *      derived from the code it checks would prove nothing.
 *   1. INDEPENDENT DERIVATION. Every expected figure is a literal in this file,
 *      and every literal is confirmed a second time by a method the engine does
 *      not use: the loan is walked month by month and has to land on zero, and
 *      the HELOC balance is grown by repeated multiplication rather than by
 *      `Math.pow`. Nothing here re-runs the production expression to find out
 *      what the answer should be.
 *   2. PROPAGATION. This is one coupled model, not a renewal calculator with a
 *      private copy of the debt picture. Move the authoritative opening HELOC
 *      balance, its pending charges, or the mortgage payment in the plan, and
 *      the renewal the household reads has to move with it.
 *   3. MUTATION. Each material formula and branch is broken on purpose in the
 *      engine source, and the answer has to change. A formula that cannot be
 *      broken was not being tested.
 *   4. MIGRATION EQUIVALENCE, for the variable scenario. The exact expression
 *      `public/modellers.js` ran before this move, against the real published
 *      inputs, at every one of the 3,822 slider positions the page can reach.
 *      Variable must match to the cent and fixed must not — a fixed option that
 *      produced the same numbers would be a label with no arithmetic behind it.
